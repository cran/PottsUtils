Description: There are three sets of functions. The first produces
             basic properties of a graph and generates samples from
             multinomial distributions to facilitate the simulation
	     functions (they maybe used for other purposes as well).
	     The second provides various simulation functions for a
	     Potts model in Potts, R. B. (1952)
	     <doi:10.1017/S0305004100027419>.
	     The third currently includes only one function which
	     computes the normalizing constant of a Potts model
	     based on simulation results.
